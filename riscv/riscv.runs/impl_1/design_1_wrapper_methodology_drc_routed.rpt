2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT design_1_i/core_0/inst/if_stage_instance_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/core_0/inst/id_stage_instance/fpu_cntrl_instance/fpu_op_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/core_0/inst/id_stage_instance/fpu_cntrl_instance/fpu_op_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/core_0/inst/id_stage_instance/fpu_cntrl_instance/fpu_op_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/core_0/inst/id_stage_instance/fpu_cntrl_instance/fpu_op_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/core_0/inst/id_stage_instance/fpu_cntrl_instance/fpu_op_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/core_0/inst/id_stage_instance/fpu_cntrl_instance/fpu_op_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/core_0/inst/id_stage_instance/fpu_cntrl_instance/fpu_op_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/core_0/inst/id_stage_instance/fpu_cntrl_instance/fpu_op_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/core_0/inst/id_stage_instance/fpu_cntrl_instance/fpu_op_reg[4] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/core_0/inst/id_stage_instance/fpu_cntrl_instance/fpu_op_reg[4]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#6 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/core_0/inst/id_stage_instance/fpu_cntrl_instance/fpu_op_reg[5] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/core_0/inst/id_stage_instance/fpu_cntrl_instance/fpu_op_reg[5]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#7 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/core_0/inst/id_stage_instance/fpu_cntrl_instance/fpu_rd_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/core_0/inst/id_stage_instance/fpu_cntrl_instance/fpu_rd_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#8 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/core_0/inst/id_stage_instance/fpu_cntrl_instance/fpu_rs1_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/core_0/inst/id_stage_instance/fpu_cntrl_instance/fpu_rs1_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

ULMTCS-1#1 Warning
Control Sets use limits recommend reduction  
This design uses 1061 control sets (vs. available limit of 13300, determined by 1 control set per CLB). This exceeds the control set use guideline of 7.5 percent. This is at a level where reduction is RECOMMENDED (see UG949). Use report_control_sets to get more details.
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 8 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
